Difference between land squares
    Location
    Surrounding squares
    Price
    Description
    Number of times viewed
    Number of times trades
    Number of times "tagged"

Game Experience Issues
    Start of map is difficult
    After spending money, status queue is met and motivation gone
    Game does on work unless a critical mass of users are active
    Presense of other players not felt
    Strategy is shallow
    Gameplay is repeditive
    Game is math intensive
    Land is often not grouped together

Ideas
    Make game zero sum, new player money comes out of taxes and fees?
    Income Revamp
        Tagging (See below)
        Taxes and fees go into bank
            Rebates are a flat amount, but increase each time that a property is bought.
            Extra money for buying and/or selling land
    3rd element
        Cash, Land, ???
    API that gets addresses and checks how often they meet a metric
    API to get population of square

Mechanincs
    Buy low, sell high
    Land Improvement
    Land expands natually
    Tagging others land

Tagging the world
    Tag others land
        They recieve money out of group bank
            How much?
            How?
                For each tag?
                For each user that tags?
            How to avoid bot abuse
        Content or comment
            How would comments be viewed

How to fight bots
    Something only humans can do
        reCaptcha
        Complex strategy
        Confirm existance of browser, mouse movements
        Make map domination trivial
        Make map domination impossible
