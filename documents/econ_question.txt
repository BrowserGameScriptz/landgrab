I am creating a game that is very economical in nature. There is a map of the world split into about 15,000 squares, and players can claim (for free), buy, and sell land. I'll get into details later, but the core question and issue I have is a common one among games.

**A new player has to be able to participate, which likely means having money. This causes the following two issues.**

Firstly, if every new player has money, users can create dupe account to get lots of free money, and depending on implementation, transfer the value to a master account.

Secondly, players may be constantly having smaller net worth as more players join, which is not good for games. Players like to progress to become larger, not smaller. I'm assuming that means my game needs a lose condition.

**My implantation of the game is as follows.**

You set a price on land, but have to pay an hourly tax (say 1 percent) on that price, to prevent players from sitting on land by pricing it too large. Those taxes get evenly distributed among all land. A portion of that tax money goes towards a bank (like a monopoly bank) that is used to fund new players. The world will have a set amount of money in existence (Likely a trillion).

**I see two issues with this.**


Secondly, this doesn't truly solve the issue dupe accounts.
