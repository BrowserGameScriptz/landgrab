Bug
    "When I was trying to buy a land that was priced below the amount of money I had, I couldn't buy it if I typed in a new price that was higher than the amount of money I had. Changing the new price to an amount lower than the amount of money I had allowed me to buy it, and then I was able to change the price I was selling for back to what I originally wanted."
