Bug
    "When I was trying to buy a land that was priced below the amount of money I had, I couldn't buy it if I typed in a new price that was higher than the amount of money I had. Changing the new price to an amount lower than the amount of money I had allowed me to buy it, and then I was able to change the price I was selling for back to what I originally wanted."

Ideas
    Fee for claiming land
    Rebates are a flat amount, but increase each time that a property is bought.
        Might make it simplier, easier to understand, and magnify demand for high value areas without making them money losers.
    Make game zero sum, new player money comes out of taxes and fees?
